Initialize the dictionary "courses" to store user input
prompt users for information pertaining to a course including: course ID, course name, and course subject
continue to prompt users for information until user enters the word done
Once user enters the word "done", prompt user to enter the subject for the course they would like to search
Create a flag to check if course exists by using true or false
If the course ID exists, display course Id and course name
then set flag to true so it will not display "no course found"
If no course found, display message "No course Found"
